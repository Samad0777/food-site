🍽️ Happy Tummy – Restaurant Website

This is not just another “food website template.”
I’m building this project from scratch while learning React.js and improving my frontend skills. The goal is to practice real-world concepts like routing, responsive design, animations, and clean component structure.

✨ What’s inside?

Custom built UI with Tailwind CSS (mobile-first)

Smooth navigation using React Router DOM

Animated sections powered by Framer Motion

Focus on writing clean, reusable components

📌 Current Progress

✅ Home page Completed
✅ About page Completed
✅ Menu page is Completed
✅ Book Table page is Adedd
✅ Blog page is ongoing
✅ Responsive layout 
✅ Contact Page is ongoing
✅UI is complete
🚧Functional components isn't complete like Forms and etc.

🎯 Why this project?

Instead of just following tutorials, I wanted to design and code a complete website myself, where every section I build helps me practice layouts, responsiveness, and component structuring.
