                <span className="font-medium">Quality Beef:</span> The heart of
                a perfect burger is top-notch beef. Opt for fresh, high-quality
                ground beef with a fat content of about 20% for the juiciest,
                most flavorful results.

                <span className="font-medium">Seasoning:</span> Simplicity is
                key here. A generous pinch of salt and black pepper just before
                cooking will enhance the beef's natural flavors without

                <span className="font-medium">Don’t Overwork the Meat:</span>{" "}
                When forming your patties, be gentle. Overworking the meat can
                lead to dense, tough burgers. You want a patty that's firm
                enough to hold together, but not compressed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Cooking:</span> High heat is
                crucial. Whether you're grilling or pan-searing, make sure your
                cooking surface is hot enough to form a nice crust on the patty,
                sealing in those delicious juices.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Resting:</span> Allow your cooked
                burgers to rest for a few minutes before serving. This lets the
                juices redistribute throughout the patty, ensuring a moist and
                flavorful bite.
